<h1>Majharul Islam Siyam</h1>
<p>Hi, this is Siyam. I study Law in Univesity of Dhaka. I am from Joypurhat, North Bengal. I grow up there. I completed my SSC in Joypurhat then I moved to Dhaka for studying in COllege and from then I started living in Dhaka but now I am at my home for this pandemic.</p>
<p>We have become very lazy since the starting of COVID-19. We have nothing to do but eating and sleeping and making ourselves bulky. One day while I was resting in my bed a idea grew in my head. I started researching about freelancing try to start with Data Entry jobs as I know the basic things in computer very well. I made Freelancing ID in several market places watching youtube. But I did not get any job. Then I decided to grow my skill in a specific field and I choose Web Development because it attracts me much. I heard about "Shikhbe Shobai" from a friend and now I am here with you attending the classes. Money earning is not my prime object as I read in a ROYAL subject and my family earns enough to support me. Rather I want to develop a professional skill. That is why I am here.</p>
